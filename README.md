This is (part of) my ~/bin directory.

Things here usually serve a purpose, but most were quickly hacked together (some of them many, many years ago).

	anagrams - create anagrams of the letters of the first word received
	check_aliases - analyse your aliases
	feriados_portugueses - show Portuguese holidays
	fileintersect - lines from a first file that are present in one of other files
	filewithout - lines of a file that are not in another file
	highlight - highlight patterns in a file
	moonphases - phases of the moon
	nextcycledir - cycle through a series of directories
	samefile - check for duplicated files
	pwhereis - a more thorough version of whereis
	trim - trims each line to a maximum number of chars
