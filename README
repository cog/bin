This is (part of) my ~/bin directory.

Things here usually serve a purpose, but most were quickly hacked together (some of them many, many years ago).

	anagrams.pl - create anagrams of the letters of the first word received
	check_aliases.pl - analyse your aliases
	feriados_portugueses.pl - show Portuguese holidays
	fileintersect.pl - lines from a first file that are present in one of other files
	highlight.pl - highlight patterns in a file
	moonphases.pl - phases of the moon
	nextcycledir.pl - cycle through a series of directories
	trim.pl - trims each line to a maximum number of chars
